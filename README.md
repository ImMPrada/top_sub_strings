## Sub strings

A challenge on [Odins project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-sub-strings)

Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
